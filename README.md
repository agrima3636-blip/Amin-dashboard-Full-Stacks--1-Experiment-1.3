Title :  Develop an admin dashboard with CSS Grid layout and dynamic theme switching.

This project is a simple admin dashboard created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a clean, card-style layout that adapts well to different screen sizes and includes a light and dark mode toggle that remembers the user’s preference.
Defined approach : 
 Step 1: Decide the main sections of the dashboard such as the header, navigation, analytics, users, and settings. This helps            in planning the overall structure.
 Step 2: Place a header at the top of the page that shows the dashboard title and includes a button for switching between light          and dark mode.
 Step 3: Arrange the remaining sections below the header as simple cards so that each part of the dashboard is clearly visible           and well organized.
 Step 4: Use appropriate colors, spacing, and alignment to make the dashboard clean, readable, and visually appealing.
 Step 5: Ensure the layout adjusts properly on smaller screen sizes so the dashboard works well on mobile devices.
 Step 6: Add a light and dark mode option and save the user’s selected theme for future visits.
 Step 7: Test the dashboard in a web browser to verify that all sections, responsiveness, and theme switching work smoothly.
